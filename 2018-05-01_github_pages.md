#### Objective: 
Be able to publish my webpages on github and then be able to share.

#### Situation:
Taking Udacity classes, it's very important to be able to share my code or webpages.

#### Resources:
github.io

#### Procedure:
- The quick and easy way is to add the github link to the end of this:
`http://htmlpreview.github.io/?`
example: `http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/gh-pages/2.3.2/index.html`
- Or to setup a more permanent link, do the following on our GitHub repository:
	1. Open our repository on GitHub.com.
	2. Click on Settings tab.
	3. Scroll down to GitHub Pages.
	4. Under Source select our master branch, save and apply.
	5. That's it, the site is live and ready. There should be a link provided to you in the section.
